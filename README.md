# EDealer Guaranteed Trade (Web)

## Prerequisites

* `node` v8.0.0 or greater
* `yarn` latest

## Getting started

Install dependencies:

    yarn install

Start the development server:

    yarn start

Point your browser to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Development

When you start the development server, your terminal will be split into three
virtual terminal spaces:
- unit test watch output
- webpack dev server log -- host page
- webpack dev server log -- api server

Note: There are two dev servers to simulate the integration context of a 3rd party
site laoding this application.

The virtual terminals can scrolled on your Mac using the normal two-fingered
scrolling gesture.

### Unit Tests

Unit tests can be run like this:

    yarn test

When you start up the dev server with `yarn start`, unit tests are run every
time a file is saved. The tests include an assortment of snapshot and
functional tests. If developing a feature invalidates a previous test snapshot,
a new snapshot can be generated by hitting the u key in the test watch space.

### UI Tests

Run the UI tests like this:

    yarn test:ui

These tests are not run when files are saved. However, they are run when commits
are pushed to the repo.
